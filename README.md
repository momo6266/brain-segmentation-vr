The VR Brain Anatomy Education Application is an immersive virtual reality tool developed to revolutionize medical education in neuroanatomy. Using Unity, SteamVR, and advanced 3D modeling with Blender and 3D Slicer, this project transforms MRI and CT scan data into a fully interactive, three-dimensional model of the human brain. The application enables medical students and professionals to explore brain anatomy in a dynamic environment, offering a hands-on approach to learning complex structures and functions.

Key Features
Anatomical Accuracy: Utilizes MRI data for precise 3D representations of brain structures, providing an authentic educational experience.
Interactive Learning: Users can rotate, dissect, and zoom in on specific brain regions. The application also includes quizzes and informative overlays to enhance learning.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed with Figma for intuitive navigation, with compatibility for various VR devices, including Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Valve Index.
Real-Time Feedback and Evaluation: Includes a quiz feature that assesses users' understanding of brain anatomy, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
